# How I Created This Site

Well first things first... I installed the [Blog Starter Kit](https://vercel.com/new/templates) template from Vercel.com. I know, I know, it's kinda cheating but it brings me to an important point: don't get paralyzed trying to build your first practice project.

## Picking Your First Project

It took me over 2 months to slowly get through a great [React.js course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/), which gave a rundown of how to also use Next.js and Vercel. The day I finished the course, _panic_ set in. **What do I do now?**

This is an ironic place to stop the first draft...
